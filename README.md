# Fishify
Final project for RPL course, made with Android SDK using Object-oriented paradigm.

Everything I wrote here based on my own understanding of object-oriented paradigm so please take precaution when you want to adapt this kind of coding style.

I did not take any guarantee if the code above make your Android phone explode when you try to run it. Also, there is no instance retaining on Controller class so you have to re-instantiate the Controller if the view is recreated.
